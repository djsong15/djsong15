- Hello, I’m Daniel.
- During the COVID-19 pandemic, I taught myself some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript via the Odin Project.
- I currently exercise these skills in my work by automating various recruiting processes, simplifying how my team tracks and reports data, and being a Google Apps Script expert in my org.
- 👋 🤓 💻
