# Hello, I’m Daniel.
📝 During the COVID-19 pandemic, I began to teach myself some basic JavaScript, CSS, and HTML via the Odin Project.

🤔 I then used these skills in my job to automate various recruiting processes and simplify how my teams track and report data via Google Apps Script.

🎓 I recently completed my technical residency at Codesmith and am actively looking for full-stack developer roles. I am adept in:
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Express
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- CSS & HTML

**Welcome to my GitHub** 👋 🤓 💻
