- Hello, Iâ€™m Daniel.
- During the COVID-19 pandemic, I began to teach myself some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript via the Odin Project.
- I then used these skills in my job to automate various recruiting processes and simplify how my teams track and report data via Google Apps Script.
- Currently, I am enrolled in a bootcamp to further my studies and become full-fledged programmer.
- Welcome ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ¤“ ðŸ’»
