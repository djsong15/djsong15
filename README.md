# Hello, I’m Daniel.
📝 During the COVID-19 pandemic, I began to teach myself some basic JavaScript, CSS, and HTML via the Odin Project.

🤔 I then applied these skills in my recruiting operations work to automate various recruiting processes and simplify how my teams track and report data using Google Apps Script.

🎓 I recently completed my technical residency at Codesmith and am actively looking for full-stack developer roles. I am adept in:
- React ⚛️
- Redux Toolkit 🧪
- TypeScript/JavaScript ⌨️
- Express/Node 🚂
- MongoDB 🍃
- PostgreSQL 🐘
- CSS & HTML ✍️

**Welcome to my GitHub** 👋 🤓 💻
